Hi! This is a little project I worked on a bit back in my Scratch days and figured I'd turn into a real thing. 

The Koch Snowflake is a fractal formed by repeatedly placing a triangle at the center of each edge. 

![Displays the process of building a Koch Snowflake. Starting with an equilateral triangle, a tangent equilateral triangle is iteratively placed on the outside of each edge's center.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/KochFlake.svg/1024px-KochFlake.svg.png)

I'll leave a few links in case you're interested in Koch Curves in the links section.

## hi maffie
Anyway, the project is pretty simple. Made using the Canvas API. Makes use of a value noise class [I wrote](https://github.com/maffiemaffie/maffie-noise).
